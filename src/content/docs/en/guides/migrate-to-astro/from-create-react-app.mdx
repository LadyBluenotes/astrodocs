Here are some key concepts and migration strategies to help you get started. Use the rest of our docs and our [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) to keep going!

## Key Similarities between Create React App and Astro

- The [syntax of `.astro` files is similar to JSX](/en/core-concepts/astro-syntax/#differences-between-astro-and-jsx). Writing Astro should feel familiar.

- Astro uses file-based routing, and [allows specially named pages to create dynamic routes](/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes).

- Astro is [component-based](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/), and your markup structure will be similar before and after your migration.

- Astro has [official integrations for React, Preact, and Solid](/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/) so you can use your existing JSX components. Note that in Astro, these files **must** have a `.jsx` or `.tsx` extension.

- Astro has support for [installing NPM packages](/en/guides/imports/#npm-packages), including React libraries. Many of your existing dependencies will work in Astro.

## Key Differences between Create React App and Astro

When you rebuild your Create React App site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- [MPA vs SPA](/en/concepts/mpa-vs-spa/): Create React App is a single-page application that uses `index.js` as your project's root. Astro is a multi-page site, and `index.astro` is your home page.

- [`.astro` components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) are not written as exported functions that return page templating. Instead, you'll split your code into a "code fence" for your JavaScript and a body exclusively for the HTML you generate.

- [Content-focus](/en/concepts/why-astro/): Astro was designed primarily for content-focused sites with small pieces of interactivity. An existing Create React App app might be built for high client-side interactivity and may include items that are difficult to replicate using `.astro` components, such as dashboards.

## Convert your Create React App Project

Each project migration will look different, but there are some common actions you will perform when converting from Create React App to Astro.

### Create a new Astro project
Use the `create astro` command for your package manager to launch Astro's CLI wizard or choose a community theme from the [Astro Theme Showcase](https://astro.build/themes).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters (e.g. `docs`, `blog`, `portfolio`). Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](/en/install/auto/#starter-templates).

 <PackageManagerTabs>
    <Fragment slot="npm">
    ```shell
    # launch the Astro CLI Wizard 
    npm create astro@latest

    # create a new project with an official example
    npm create astro@latest -- --template <example-name>
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="pnpm">
    ```shell
    # launch the Astro CLI Wizard 
    pnpm create astro@latest

    # create a new project with an official example
    pnpm create astro@latest --template <example-name>
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="yarn">
    ```shell
    # launch the Astro CLI Wizard 
    yarn create astro@latest

    # create a new project with an official example
    yarn create astro@latest --template <example-name>
    ```
    </Fragment>
  </PackageManagerTabs>

Then, copy your existing Create React App project files over to your new Astro project in a separate folder outside of `src`.

### Install React integration

Astro has a [React integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/) that allows you to use your Create React App components in Astro, as is.

To install this, run the following from your project directory and follow the prompts:

```sh
# Using NPM
npx astro add react
# Using Yarn
yarn astro add react
# Using PNPM
pnpm astro add react
```

### Put your source code in `src`

Following [Astro's project structure](/en/core-concepts/project-structure/):

1. **Keep** Create React App's `public/` folder untouched, except for the `index.html` file. 
   
    Astro uses the `public/` directory for static assets, just like Create React App. Astro's entry point for your application will now be `index.astro`, which is located in the `/pages` directory.

2. **Copy or Move** Create React App's other files and folders (e.g. `components`, `hooks`, `styles`, etc.) into Astro's `src/` folder as you rebuild your site, following [Astro's project structure](/en/core-concepts/project-structure/).

    Astro's `src/pages/` folder is a special folder used for file-based routing. All other folders are optional. The contents of your `src/` folder can be organized anyway. You can also include common folders in Astro projects include `src/layouts/`, `src/components`, `src/styles`, `src/scripts`.

:::tip
The conversion of all files from Create React App to Astro is not required. By directly importing your `<App />` component directly into `index.astro`, your application will be ready to go.

### The Astro config file

Astro has a configuration file at the root of your project called [`astro.config.mjs`](/en/guides/configuring-astro/). This is used only for configuring your Astro project and any installed integrations, including [SSR adapters](/en/guides/deploy/).
